Hello!

This is a simple repository for learning projects and/or example code I've created. This is not an exhaustive list of learning projects I've done, but represents a sample. My current lessons and topics are sourced from ChatGPT, Gemini, HarvardX lessons (here: https://rafalab.dfci.harvard.edu/pages/harvardx.html), or some combination thereof.  
 

This is personal project of mine, intended to expand my knowledge of Python, R, github, and data analysis pipelines and machine learning broadly. These files contain many of my own custom lines, which I've added to test my understanding of the syntax, operation, and limits of the functions and processes. The current data used is simple and often hardcoded into the .py files directly for now, as it is just an example for now.
