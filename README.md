Hello!

This is a simple repository for examples of learning projects I've coded and created. This is not an exhaustive list of projects, but a simple sample list. 
My lessons and topics are sourced from ChatGPT, Gemini, HarvardX lessons (here: https://rafalab.dfci.harvard.edu/pages/harvardx.html), or some combination thereof.  
These files contain many of my own custom lines, which I've essentially added as tests to make sure I fully understand the syntax, operation, and limits of the functions and processes.  

My progress in learning these languages and workflows is on-going and represents a personal project for me to expand my knowledge of Python, R, and data analysis pipelines in general. It additionally serves as a way for me to understand the full functionality of github.
