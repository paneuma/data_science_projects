Hello!

This is a simple repository for examples of learning projects I've coded and created. This is not an exhaustive list of projects, but a simple sample list. 
My lessons and topics are sourced from ChatGPT, Gemini, HarvardX lessons (here: https://rafalab.dfci.harvard.edu/pages/harvardx.html), or some combination thereof.  
These files contain many of my own custom lines, which I've essentially added as tests to make sure I fully understand the syntax, operation, and limits of the functions and processes.  

This is personal project of mine, intended to expand my knowledge of Python, R, github, and data analysis pipelines broadly.
