Hello!

This is a simple repository for learning and teaching projects and examples. 
Each file is sourced from some version of a training module--could be ChatGPT5, HarvardX lessons (here: https://rafalab.dfci.harvard.edu/pages/harvardx.html), or some other source. 
These files will also contain many of my own custom lines, which I've essentially used as tests or expansions just to make sure that I fully understand the syntax, operation, and limits of the functions and of the code functions contained within. 

This work is on-going, and represents a personal project for me to expand my knowledge of Python, R, and data analysis pipeline possibilties in general. It additionally serves as a way for me to understand the full functionality of github.
